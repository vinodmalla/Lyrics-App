# Creating a New Project

## Step 1: Project Folder
Here you must define the path, where your new project folder should be created, and specify the name of the new project.

> A new folder will be created and thus the directory shouldn't exist

## Step 2: Project Files
Here you must either choose existing files or use the templates for the config file, design file, library file and (optional linker file).

> It's ok to use the templates but the design file should be your synthesized circuit

## Step 3: File Names
Here you must define the name of the module and name of the library to be used for the simulation.

> The module name must be used in the design file and the library name in the library file

## Tip
To use standard value for module name or library name, or to use the template for config file, design file, library file or linker file, simply double-click the text field.
