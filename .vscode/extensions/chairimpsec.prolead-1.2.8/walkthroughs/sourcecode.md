# Getting the Source Code

## Cloning the Code
This option is suitable if you haven't clone the source code of PROELAD yet and want to specify the path where it should be cloned to.

> Choose to specify a path and then clone the code to it

## Specifing Own Path
This option is suitable if you have already cloned the source code of PROLEAD somewhere and want to specify the path where it is located.

> Choose to specify a path that contains an already cloned code and its executable

## Choosing Standard Path
This option is suitable if you want to clone the source code of PROLEAD but it doesn't matter where it will be cloned to.

> Choose to use the standard path (in extension folder) and clone the code

## Hint
In order to use PROLEAD you will have to get the source code and build it, to get then the executable files. The preferred way to get the source code is to clone it from our [Github repository](https://github.com/ChairImpSec/PROLEAD).
